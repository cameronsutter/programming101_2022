My programming class' work and assignments from the 2022 school year

# Running your code
1. Open a terminal
1. Navigate to this folder
1. Run this command `npm run <yourName>` ('alexis', 'jd', 'sam' ... without the 's)

# Seeing if assignments will pass the test
1. Open a terminal
1. Navigate to this folder
1. Run this command `npm test`

# Submitting your assignments
1. `git add .`
1. `git commit -m <some message>`
1. `git pull` (you should do this at the beginning of each session)

Or just use GitHub Desktop to do these commands in the UI (User Interface)
